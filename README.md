Keylogger Implementation (Educational Purpose)
Project Overview

The Keylogger Implementation project is designed for educational and cybersecurity research purposes only, to help learners understand how keylogging mechanisms work and how to detect, prevent, and secure systems against them.

This project demonstrates how keystroke capture works using Python, helping security professionals and students explore defensive techniques in endpoint protection, intrusion detection, and ethical hacking simulations.

Do not use this code on any system without explicit permission. Misuse may violate laws and ethical guidelines.

Features

Captures keyboard inputs in real time.

Logs keys to a local text file.

Records timestamped entries for analysis.

Runs in the background until stopped by the user.

Demonstrates the working principle of malware keylogging for cybersecurity defense learning.

Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Pynput Library: For listening to keyboard events.

Time Module: For timestamping.

File Handling: To save logs securely.

How It Works

The program uses pynput.keyboard.Listener to monitor key presses.

Each key pressed is stored in a log file along with the timestamp.

Logs can be analyzed to understand how keyloggers record user input.

Can be stopped manually with a specific key (like Esc).
